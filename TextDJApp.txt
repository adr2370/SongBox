Pitch:
	What is the most important thing in life/college? Parties
	What is the most important part of a party? Music
	Sites now are too complicated and no interaction with party goers, especially without smartphones
	So we created INSERT NAME HERE
	All I do is go to the website and create a party
		OPTIONAL:
		seeded with facebook music
	When you show up to the party, just text join INSERT NUMBER HERE, go ahead and try it now
	Now you can freely text any song suggestions with add and the song suggestion
		OPTIONAL:
		Duplicates from different people will increase the rank of that song on the queue
		You can also text info for information about the current song or text queue to get the current queue
		You can also rate the current song by texting positive or negative words, this sucks, awesome, etc.
		Since I am the party master, I can change the volume of the song and pause or skip the next one
		Now text karaoke followed by a song name to play a karaoke version of the song
		Let's make sure we see karaoke mode so if everyone could text karaoke never gonna give you up
